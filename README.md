### Built with

### What I learned

I used this project to practice and consolidate my knowledge of flexbox properties. It was an opportunity to practice positioning elements on the screen using flexbox.

### Continued development

In the future I intend to continue practicing the use of flexbox to position elements on the screen and, later on, I'm going to go deeper into the use of css grid layout.
